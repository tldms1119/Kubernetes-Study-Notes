## Jobs

### 📌 Definition
**Jobs** are used to run one-time tasks in Kubernetes. Unlike Deployments, they are designed for **finite workloads** that terminate after completion.
- completions: Total number of successful pod executions required
- parallelism: Maximum number of pods running at the same time
- backoffLimit: Number of retries before the Job is marked as failed
- activeDeadlineSeconds: Once job reaches its time limit, it won't deploy additional pods, even if the `backoffLimit` is not yet reached

### ✅ Key Notes
- `restartPolicy` must be `Never` or `OnFailure`
- Jobs are namespace-scoped

### 🧪 Useful Commands
```bash
# Create Job
kubectl apply -f job.yaml

# Get Jobs
kubectl get jobs

# Describe Job
kubectl describe job batch-job

# View Pods created by Job
kubectl get pods --selector=job-name=batch-job
```
